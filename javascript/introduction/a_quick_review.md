### Introduction

This course assumes that you have a decent grasp on the fundamentals of JavaScript. If you just finished our [Foundations course](https://theodinproject.com/paths/foundations) then you should skip this review and move on to the next lesson. If it's been a while and you're coming from the Ruby courses, you will probably want to take a day or two to refresh yourself on the basics.

### Review

Running through "part 1" of [MDN's JavaScript basics course](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics) is a great idea for a refresher on the syntax. If you just want a quick reference to skim, try [LearnXinY](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/javascript/).

Try not to worry too much about forgetting past materials after not using them for a while. As you progress through the curriculum, you will almost certainly find yourself needing to look up topics covered in Foundations that you haven't touched upon in a while. This isn't indicative of any shortcoming on your end; it's just part of being a developer.
